## Philosophy

The philosophy is based on the idea of ​​finding a dynamic equilibrium point between the primordial spirituality of human nature and the person of tomorrow.

The urban rhythm and mythology of romance, tradition and experiment are two beginnings on the scales of a systematic but sincere search for one's own line.

The inner wind and constant acceleration of time inspire the brand ideologist Anna Markovich to create an understandable, verified line of cuts in a moderate combination with romantic elements of the European medieval style and the ideas of cyberpunk culture <span id="a1">[\[1\]](#f1)</span>.
