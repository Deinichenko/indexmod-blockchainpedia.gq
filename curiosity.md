# {{page.title}} Description

A socket, which is not worth poking your fingers, a transformer booth, which is not necessary to climb, corner fenced red and white ribbon, for which should not cross, and a counter that records each violated the law. This is a simulator, a simple example to teach a person to step over the basic instincts such as the instinct of self-preservation. It is congenital and acquired reflexes hinder us on the path of discovery.
