# {{page.title}} — The video

The circular locomotive depot Nikolaev railway, built in Moscow in the middle of the XIX century, has undergone over the years of its existence, a lot of changes. From the depot, it has become a “Crow Colony” with shops, restaurants, warehouses, garage and indispensable dump. We are witnessing the transformation of the old architectural buildings, losing their individuality in interaction with everyday life.
